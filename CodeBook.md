# Code Book
This code book summarises the data shown in TidyData.txt.

## Background Information
Experiments were carried out on a sample size of 30 volunteers between the age of 19-48 years.
Each test subject wore a Samsung Galaxy S II on their waist while perform various activities (listed in the next section).
Data collected are from the accelerometer and gyroscope within the smartphone.

## Activities
* WALKING
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* SITTING
* STANDING
* LAYING

## Identifiers
* Subject : ID of test subject
* Activity : Activity associated with the measurements taken

## Measurements taken 
The data featured in this dataset comes are linear acceleration measurements from the accelerometer and angular velocity from the gyroscope embedded on Samsung Galaxy S II.
The measurements were taken at an interval of 50Hz.
Time-signals are denoted with the 'time' prefix, and frequency-signals denoted with the 'frequency' prefix.
The measurements are separated into signals corresponding to different axes X, Y and Z.
Furthermore, the acceleration measurements are categorised into body and gravitational measurements.
The variable of interest in this dataset are the mean value, mean(), and standard deviation, std().
The measurements that can be found in TidyData.txt are as follow:
